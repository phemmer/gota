gota is a Go implementation of several technical analysis algorithms. There is also the [talib](https://github.com/phemmer/talib) library which provides even more algorithms than gota currently offers. The main differences between gota and [talib](https://github.com/phemmer/talib) is that gota is native Go as opposed to C wrapped in Go, and gota is optimized for streaming & large data sets.

The gota library is mainly intended for my own use. I provide it in case it may be of use to others. Meaning that you are welcome to use it in your own project, but vendoring is highly recommended as I will not hesitate to make breaking API changes if I think it makes sense to do so.
